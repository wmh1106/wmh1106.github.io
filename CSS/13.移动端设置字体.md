# 移动端设置字体

- 各个手机系统有自己的默认字体，且都不支持微软雅黑
- 如无特殊需求，手机端无需定义中文字体，使用系统默认
- 英文字体和数字字体可使用 Helvetica ，三种系统都支持

```css
/* 移动端定义字体的代码 */
body{font-family:Helvetica;}
```

```html
测试：

“Would you like me to give you a formula for success? 
It’s quite simple, really. Double your rate of failure. 
You’re thinking of failure as the enemy of success. 
But it isn’t at all… You can be discouraged by failure – or you can learn from it. 
So go ahead and make mistakes. 
Make all you can. Because, remember that’s where you’ll find success. 
On the far side.”
